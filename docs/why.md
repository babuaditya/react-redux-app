# Why We Use `clsx` for Variant Management

In our application, we use the [`clsx`](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) package to handle **conditional and variant-based className management** in a clean, readable, and scalable way. Here's why it's our tool of choice:

## üí° What is `clsx`?

`clsx` is a tiny utility that allows you to conditionally join classNames together. It‚Äôs often used as a lightweight alternative to `classnames`, but with better performance and smaller bundle size.

## üöÄ Why We Use It

### 1. **Simplifies Conditional Class Names**

Instead of writing verbose ternaries or manual string concatenation, `clsx` makes conditional logic elegant:

```tsx
// Without clsx
const buttonClass = isActive ? 'btn active' : 'btn';

// With clsx
const buttonClass = clsx('btn', { active: isActive });
```


# Alternatives to `clsx` for Variant & ClassName Management

While `clsx` is a great tool for conditional class management, there are several other tools and approaches you can use depending on your app‚Äôs complexity, scale, and team preferences.

## 1. üß† `classnames`

### üì¶ NPM: [`classnames`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames)

### ‚úÖ Pros:
- Very similar API to `clsx`
- Mature, widely adopted, well-documented
- Supports nested conditionals and arrays

### ‚ùå Cons:
- Slightly larger bundle size than `clsx`
- Slower performance in large apps

### Example:
```tsx
import classNames from 'classnames';

const buttonClass = classNames('btn', {
  'btn-primary': isPrimary,
  'btn-disabled': isDisabled,
});
```
